1. improve locate() so that it can traverse and
searches for a triangle on the mesh with holes

2. improve insertvertex() so that it doesn't
traverse holes

3. fix the bug that -r argument is needed for
triangulating spx_z.1.spa and spx_z.1.sma
that is,
instead of triangulating as
  triangle -k -r spx_z.1.spa spx_z.1.sma

we should triangulate without the -r flag

4. after writing the last fine triangle to .ele
file, close the file, reopen it and write the .ele
header (i.e. # of triangles, etc) as the 1st line.

5. make sure all vertextricounts (# of triangles
touching a vertex) are calculated correctly.

6. deallocate a vertex when its vertextricount=0
