  CONTENTS:
  
    Reads a *pre-order* Streaming Mesh as a *compact* *pre-order* mesh. This
    requires reordering and reindexing of the vertices. It will fail if more
    than 'limit_buffer_size' triangles need to be stored. The 'preserve_order'
    flag specifies whether the algorithm is allowed to reorder triangles.

    If the algorithm must preserve the triangle order then the (triangle-)span
    of the stream dictates the maximal number of triangles it needs to buffer.
    This number will be prohibitively large for streaming meshes that were 
    created with some kind of depth first traversal.
    If the algorithm is allowed to reorder triangles, then the (vertex-)width
    of the stream roughly dictates the maximal number of triangles it needs to
    buffer.

  CHANGE HISTORY:
  
    13 January 2005 -- major bug fix for behaviour after smreader had SM_EOF
     6 January 2004 -- setting the 'limit_buffer_size' may fail ungraceful
    25 December 2003 -- realized that there might be a bug for 'preserve_order == false'
    18 December 2003 -- refining the code after coming back to LLNL 
    10 October 2003 -- initial version created once SM compression worked
