  CHANGE HISTORY:
  
    26 May 2005 -- fixed a Microsoft bug (floating-point in Release/Debug mode)
    05 April 2005 -- finally renamed from SMwriter_sme to SMwriter_smc
    04 April 2005 -- fixed mean SMC_END bug after SM paper was rejected ... again 
    09 January 2005 -- temporary renamed (smf->sme), but will become the new smc
    07 January 2005 -- improved cache hits ratio (sme->smf)
    05 January 2005 -- further simplified and improved in speed (smd->sme)
    27 July 2004 -- improved in speed and rates using fewer tables (smc->smd)
    3 January 2004 -- added support for pre-existing bounding box info
    28 October 2003 -- switched from Peter's hash to the STL hash_map
    15 September 2003 -- initial version created on the Monday after a tough
