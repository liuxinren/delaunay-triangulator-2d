  CHANGE HISTORY:
  
    26 May 2005 -- fixed a Microsoft bug (floating-point in Release/Debug mode)
    05 April 2005 -- finally renamed from SMreader_sme to SMreader_smc
    21 March 2005 -- read_element() calls after EOF will always return SM_EOF 
    09 January 2005 -- temporary renamed (smf->sme), but will become the new smc
    07 January 2005 -- improved cache hits ratio (sme->smf)
    06 January 2005 -- further simplified and improved in speed (smd->sme)
    28 July 2004 -- improved in speed and rates using fewer tables (smc->smd)
    30 October 2003 -- switched to enums and bools in peter's office
    07 October 2003 -- initial version created the day of the California recall
