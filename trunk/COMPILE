1. install OpenGL and GLUT (as well as dev packages)
2. change directory to ..../triangle/triangle/
3. configure the project in the current directory with cmake

Before configuring, you need to know where GLUT is installed
For my case, it is at '/usr/lib/libglut.so'
so I do:

cmake -D GLUT_INCLUDE_DIR=/usr/lib/ -D GLUT_glut_LIBRARY=/usr/lib/libglut.so .

Note1: the dot in the end is NOT a period ;)

Note2: the file paths are just examples. replace them with the right
ones if they are different.

Note3: you can also run wizard mode 'cmake -i' to set these variables

4. Makefile should be created by cmake, now do

make
